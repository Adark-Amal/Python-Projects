## Password Generator

### About Project

The Password Generator is a Python program that allows users to generate random passwords of a specified length. By taking user input for the desired password length, the code generates a password consisting of letters, numbers, and special characters.

### Problem Statement

The project aims to solve the problem of creating secure and random passwords for various purposes, such as online accounts, applications, or systems. By providing a simple and customizable password generator, users can generate strong passwords of a desired length.

### Algorithm

The algorithm used in the Password Generator is as follows:

1. Prompt the user to enter the desired length of the password.
2. Prepare a string containing all possible characters that can be used to generate the password, including lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, and special characters.
3. Randomly select characters from the string to form the password.
4. Print the generated password.
