## Acronym Generator

### About Project

The Acronym Generator is a Python program that generates the acronym for a given sentence. An acronym is a short form created by selecting the first letters of each word in a sequence.

### Problem Statement

The project aims to solve the problem of generating acronyms for sentences. By taking a sentence as input, the code generates the corresponding acronym by selecting the first letters of each word and capitalizing them.

### Algorithm

The algorithm used in the Acronym Generator is as follows:

1. Prompt the user to enter a sentence.
2. Split the sentence into a list of words.
3. Initialize an empty string to store the acronym.
4. For each word in the list, select the first letter and capitalize it.
5. Append the capitalized letter to the acronym string.
6. Display the generated acronym.

### Python Skills Learnt

During the development of this project, the following Python skills were utilized:

- `String manipulation:` splitting a sentence into words.
- `List indexing:` accessing individual letters of a word.
- `Loops:` iterating over a list of words.
- `String concatenation:` building the acronym by appending letters to a string.
- `String formatting:` displaying the generated acronym.

### Installation

This project does not require any external dependencies. Simply clone the repository to your local machine to access the code.

### Usage

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following command to start the Acronym Generator:
```python
    python acronym_generator.py
```
4. Enter a sentence when prompted.
5. The program will generate the acronym by selecting the first letters of each word and display it.
