## BMI Calculator

### About Project

The BMI Calculator is a simple Python program that calculates the `Body Mass Index (BMI)` based on user input of height and weight. The BMI is a measure of body fat based on an individual's weight and height. This project aims to provide a quick and convenient way to calculate and assess BMI.

### Problem Statement

The project aims to solve the problem of calculating BMI, which is an important health indicator. By providing a BMI calculator, users can easily determine their BMI and gain insights into their body weight and potential health risks associated with it.

### Algorithm

The algorithm used in the BMI calculator is straightforward:

1. Prompt the user to enter their weight in kilograms.
2. Prompt the user to enter their height in meters.
3. Calculate the BMI using the formula: `BMI = weight / (height * height)`.
4. Display the calculated BMI to the user.
5. Provide additional information about the BMI category and associated health risks.

### Python Skills Learnt

During the development of this project, the following Python skills were utilized:

- User input and output handling.
- Basic mathematical operations.
- Conditional statements for BMI category determination.
- String formatting for displaying the results.
